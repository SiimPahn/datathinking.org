<p>Health, both mental and physical, are the most important gifts we have. I have always been fortunate to navigate and afford the US healthcare system. But many more are not so lucky.</p>

<p>Improving access through knowledge and technology is a mission worth supporting. Also, I have lived in New York for 10+ and always wanted to ride the 5 Boro Bike Tour. Super excited to join One Fact to ride around the city!</p>
