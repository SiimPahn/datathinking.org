<p>For years, I've been immersed in the world of mental healthcare, witnessing the hurdles of limited information and steep costs that keep many from accessing the care they need. Fueled by a passion for change, I'm participating in the TD Five Boro Bike Tour in support of One Fact and its mission to harness equitable, open-source AI to empower patients with transparency and access to the facts and care they deserve. I invite you to stand with me in backing One Fact's vision for AI-powered equity, not inequality. Your support makes healthcare more affordable and hope more accessible for those who need it most.</p>
