Hi there! I'm Michele Tadiello, hailing all the way from Italy. During my time in the United States, I had the incredible opportunity to study at Duke University School of Medicine, where I earned a master's degree in Management in Clinical Informatics. This educational journey equipped me with the knowledge and skills to utilize digital innovation in the pursuit of improving health equityâ€”a cause that stirs deep passion within me.

Fueling my commitment to this cause, I co-founded One Fact Foundation, a remarkable tech non-profit organization dedicated to increasing global healthcare access and equity through open-source AI. Our groundbreaking work has garnered support from prestigious institutions like Columbia University, Stanford University, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

I am grateful for the chance to remain in the United States while working with One Fact Foundation. In my role, I lead the analysis of quality metrics, shedding light on the intricate relationship between price, cost, and quality. Through these insights, we strive to bring positive change to a system that is in dire need of reform.

We find ourselves at a pivotal moment in history, where technology holds immense potential to revolutionize healthcare and positively impact lives worldwide. I firmly believe that through digital innovations, we can bridge the gaps in healthcare and ensure equal access and outcomes for all. If you share my unwavering passion for this cause, I warmly invite you to join me in supporting the One Fact Foundation.

Your donations to this organization are not only tax-deductible but also directly contribute to our mission of effecting change within a broken system. Every contribution, no matter the size, plays a vital role in shaping the transformative impact we aspire to create.

Making a donation is simple. You can choose from various platforms such as Cash App, Stripe, PayPal, and Venmo. Alternatively, if you prefer traditional methods, you can send a check to the One Fact Foundation at the following address: One Fact Foundation, 2093 Philadelphia Pike #1764, Claymont, DE 19703.

For those who have donor-advised funds with Schwab Charitable or Vanguard Charitable, locating the One Fact Foundation is easy. Simply search for our Employer Identification Number (EIN) 88-2145154 in the respective dashboards of these platforms.

I genuinely appreciate your time and interest in learning about my unwavering dedication to improving health equity through digital innovation. Together, we can make a meaningful difference and pave the way for a future where healthcare is accessible to every individual, regardless of their circumstances. Let's collaborate as change agents and build a healthier, fairer world for all.
