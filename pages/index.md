> Vision: Transform health care access and efficiency globally by developing and sharing open-source artificial intelligence solutions.

(section)
Our non-profit structure allows our institutional partners - including National Institutes of Health, Yale, Harvard, and Stanford - to give us access to their highly-confidential health data for research and training our AI engine, ClinicalBERT. Open-source licensing means we can require enterprises using our tech to validate their AI against state-of-the-art health equity metrics.
